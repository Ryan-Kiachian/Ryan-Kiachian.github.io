# ‚úàÔ∏è Turbofan Performance Analysis ‚Äì MATLAB Simulation Project

**MAE Thermodynamics | MATLAB Modeling | Jet Propulsion | Thermodynamic Cycle Analysis**

In this project, I built a MATLAB-based simulation of an **ideal turbofan jet engine** with separate exhausts for core and bypass flow. The goal was to study how two critical design variables ‚Äî **bypass ratio (Œ±)** and **flight Mach number (M‚ÇÄ)** ‚Äî affect engine performance, focusing on two key metrics: **Specific Fuel Consumption (SFC)** and **Specific Thrust (ST)**.

## üß† Reflections & Recommendations

This project highlighted the power of simulation in understanding the fundamental trade-offs in turbofan engine design. By analyzing how **bypass ratio (Œ±)** and **flight Mach number (M‚ÇÄ)** affect **specific thrust (ST)** and **specific fuel consumption (SFC)**, we were able to visualize performance landscapes that align with real-world engine architectures.

### Key Observations:

- **Bypass Ratio Trade-offs**: As expected, increasing bypass ratio significantly improved fuel efficiency (lower SFC) but at the cost of lower specific thrust. This confirms why high-bypass turbofans are preferred for subsonic commercial aircraft, where fuel efficiency outweighs raw thrust requirements.

- **Mach Number Sensitivity**: At low Mach numbers, engines with higher bypass ratios performed exceptionally well in terms of SFC. However, at higher Mach numbers, the SFC penalty for high-bypass designs became more pronounced due to velocity mismatch and increasing drag effects.

- **Design Optimization Sweet Spot**: The analysis showed that there is a diminishing return in performance gains after a certain bypass ratio. For instance, the improvement in SFC from Œ± = 6 to Œ± = 8 was marginal compared to the dramatic drop in ST. This insight supports practical design choices where engine size and nacelle drag become limiting factors.

- **Validation Checkpoint**: Our calculated values at Œ± = 4 and M‚ÇÄ = 0.9 matched the provided benchmarks (e.g., SFC ‚âà 1.83E-5 kg/N¬∑s and ST ‚âà 265 N/kg/s), confirming that the model and `thermoAnalysis` function were implemented correctly.

### Model Limitations & Future Work:

- **Ideal Flow Assumptions**: Our model assumed ideal, isentropic flow and perfect mechanical efficiency. Real turbofans experience losses due to turbulence, blade tip clearance, mixing inefficiencies, and component degradation.

- **Single Operating Point**: The analysis assumes steady cruise conditions. In practice, engine design must consider transient behavior (takeoff, climb, descent), which would require multi-point analysis or integration with engine cycle software like NPSS or GasTurb.

- **Separate Nozzle Expansion**: While our model accounted for separate exhausts for core and bypass, it assumes optimal expansion to ambient pressure. In reality, nozzle design affects flow separation, shock formation, and thrust efficiency.

- **No Weight or Cost Consideration**: Increasing bypass ratio increases engine diameter, and weight. However, none of these conditions were captured in the analysis but are important in real-world aircraft performance and design trade studies.
