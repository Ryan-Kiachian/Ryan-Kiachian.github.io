# üíß Water Pump Design & Fabrication ‚Äì Multistage Mechanical Engineering Project

**MAE| Design for Manufacturing | Precision Machining | Fluid Systems**

This team project involved the full-cycle development of a **multi-cylinder piston water pump**, including design, simulation, budgeting, fabrication, and performance testing. The final product was a 4-cylinder reciprocating pump driven by a custom-fabricated steel crankshaft, designed to exceed 1 L/min of flow.

---

## üß† Project Objectives

- Design a **compact, mechanically efficient** piston-style water pump
- Simulate expected volumetric flow rates and optimize cylinder configuration
- Fabricate the entire assembly using lathes, mills, and manual machining tools
- Test flow performance at different motor speeds to verify volumetric efficiency

> üí° Target flow rate: 1.0 L/min at half speed  
> ‚úÖ Achieved: 15.7 L/min at 60 RPM  
> üî© Team-machined components: crankshaft, pistons, cylinders, mounting plates

## üß∞ Final CAD Design

After several iterations, the team finalized a 4-cylinder layout in opposing pairs, with staggered crankshaft eccentrics, U-shaped acrylic supports, aluminum constraint plates, and NPT hose fittings for water flow.

## üõ†Ô∏è Fabrication & Manufacturing Strategy

The project required detailed tolerance planning and multi-process machining, including:

- **Turning (lathe):** Pistons, cylinders, dowel pins, crankshaft shaft stock
- **Milling:** Mounting plates, constraint plates, crankshaft eccentrics
- **Reaming:** For tight press-fit and slip-fit tolerance control
- **Welding:** Steel crankshaft components and eccentric pin assemblies
- **Acrylic Joining:** Laser-cut U-supports and puzzle-fit acrylic base and top plates

Parts were machined in parallel by team members and assembled after verifying tolerances.

> üí∏ Total cost: $75 (under budget)  
> üóìÔ∏è Full fabrication timeline: 2 weeks

## üöø Testing & Results

The pump was connected to a test motor and run at both half (60 RPM) and full (120 RPM) speed using hose fittings and a faceplate mount. Volumetric flow was measured by observing water displacement in a container.

### Half-Speed Performance:
- Output flow rate: **15.7 L/min**
- Volumetric efficiency: **‚âà 80%**
- Observed minor leakage due to worn piston seals from dry testing

### Full-Speed Outcome:
- Acrylic base and top plates **snapped** after a few seconds due to vibration and bending stress
- Despite the failure, the pump **met performance goals at low speed** and exceeded design expectations

## üß† Reflections & Recommendations

This project demonstrated the challenges and rewards of end-to-end mechanical system development ‚Äî from theoretical performance to practical fabrication and system failure.

### What Worked:
- Met flow rate targets by **over 15√ó** at half speed
- Tolerancing of pistons and cylinders produced a strong seal and reliable motion
- Acrylic puzzle-fit support system was innovative and lightweight

### What Could Be Improved:
- **Acrylic structural parts** were the weak link; upgrading to aluminum would allow high-speed operation
- Press fits and bushing press tolerances were time-intensive ‚Äî could be CNC-optimized
- Future versions should account for **fatigue and vibration damping**

### Key Takeaways:
- Planning for failure (i.e., pre-designing support reinforcements) made troubleshooting faster and more effective
- Manual machining experience reinforced how **design decisions impact manufacturability**
- Collaboration and parallel work allowed us to meet aggressive deadlines
